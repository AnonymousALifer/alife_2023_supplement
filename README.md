# Supplement and Source for our 2023 ALife submission: 
## "Historical contingency in the evolution of intelligence: Potentiating mutations facilitate the evolution of associative learning in digital organisms"

Most information, especially results, can be found in an easy-to-navigate website here: 

All code and information needed to understand or replicate the work can be found in the repository. 
Important directories, like this one, should include a breakdown of what the files/directories inside of them in order to help you navigate. 

## Directory
- `/MABE2/` - Code for the Modular Agent Based Evolver 2, including the current (early) state of Avida5. 
- `/MABE2_extras/` - Various scripts (converters, visualizations, etc.) that work with data from MABE2.
- `/experiemnts/` - Setup and data for all experiments (just one for ALife 2023)
- `/global_shared_files/` - Files that are shared across multiple experiments, analyses, etc. Just to reduce the number of files that get copied to each new experiment. 
- `/supplement/` - Source code for the supplement website: 
- `/README.md` - This file.
- `/config_global.sh` - Configuration script used when running experiments.
